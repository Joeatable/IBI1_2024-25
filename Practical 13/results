1. Human SOD2 protein
 Length: 222 amino acids
 Subcellular location: Mitochondria
 
2. Online BLAST results
 Number of hits: 9347
 Percentage identity range: 58.1% â€“ 100%
 Match rate of mouse: Mouse SOD2 (P09671), Identity = 90.1%
 Note: Several other mammalian homologs (e.g. G1RJQ3) also showed high identity scores (99.1%), indicating strong evolutionary conservation of SOD2 in placental mammals.


3. Python alignments
Here are the results of code:

===== sp|P04179|SODM_HUMAN vs sp|P09671|SODM_MOUSE =====
BLOSUM62 Score: 1097.0  
Percent Identity: 90.09%

===== sp|P04179|SODM_HUMAN vs random =====
BLOSUM62 Score: -250.0  
Percent Identity: 4.50%

===== sp|P09671|SODM_MOUSE vs random =====
BLOSUM62 Score: -242.0  
Percent Identity: 4.50%

4. Conclusion
The human and mouse SOD2 proteins are the most similar, among three sequences, both in BLOSUM62 alignment score and percent identity.  
This high similarity supports their close evolutionary relationship.  
In contrast, the random sequence shows very low similarity with either species.
